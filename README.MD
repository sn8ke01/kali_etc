#Kali Config
A script to quickly configure Kali after init install
Right now it's pretty basic.

## TODO
- [ ] Install standard user
- [ ] Add Python and Pip stuff (if needed)
- [ ] Add git repositories of interest
- [ ] Local git repo installaion target
- [ ] Functions for more complex installs (so they skipped easily)
- [ ] Errors catching
